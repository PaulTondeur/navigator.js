navigator.js
============
NavigatorJS is the ultimate solution to show/hide your dom-elements based on a single state string.
This library was created to take away your pains when it comes to navigating your application between different views or application states. It provides ways to deal with (asynchronous) transitions between states without bugging you with the tedious parts. To sum up of the library's features:

- Total control over synchronous and asynchronous visual transitions
- Just-in-Time initalization of view components
- DebugConsole to show exactly which elements are uninitialized, hidden or visible
- Support for dynamic range elements and lists, like gallery items
- Nested states, move complete parts of you application and they still work
- Flow control through state validation, both synchronous and asynchronous
- Integration of popular frameworks (Backbone), but it's optional
And many more...

NavigatorJS is mostly ported from the popular AS3 library NavigatorAS3, created by Epologee (www.github.com/epologee/navigator-as3)
Most work was done by Paul Tondeur (@PaulTondeur), later joined by Michiel van der Ros (@micros). They are both members of the Bigger Boat freelance collective in Amsterdam.
